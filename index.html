            <br>
            A self-driven and ambitious student studying Computer Science (Specialist) at the University of Toronto, Canada. (Currently in 2nd Year)
            <br>
            <br>
            Years of developing high-quality, well-designed, innovative software, and collaboration with U of T's top software engineers has taken me to the frontiers of Computer Science, and given me the skills to be the software developer of tomorrow.  
            <br>
            <br>
            Blessed with an eye for detail, I can not only anticipate client needs and wants, but can also collaborate with other developers to ensure all client expectations are exceeded. Not just met. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I have 3+ years of experience with Java, and 2+ years with Python.
            <br>
            <br>
            Furthermore, I have extensive experience working with the Object-Oriented Programming paradigm, and I am equipped with an excellent knowledge of concepts such as Class Design, Polymorphism, Inheritance, and Generics. 
            <br>
            <br>
            As a TCK, I grew up in various countries around the world, which immersed me into  various cultures and languages; I am fluent in 3 major world languages. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Years of collaborating with small and large teams has given me excellent leadership and management skills - I am truly where "Computer Science meets Business"
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>I am currently looking for a software internship for Summer 2019.</strong>
